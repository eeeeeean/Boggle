To generate a random board and solve it, just give the run_me.rb script an argument'that is the length of the board:

  ruby run_me.rb 5

Or run a pre-made board like this:

  ruby run_me.rb 4 's,e,r,s,p,a,t,g,l,i,n,e,s,e,r,s'

That board is thanks to http://ai.stanford.edu/~chuongdo/boggle/index.html
