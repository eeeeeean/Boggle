 in the grow method i should give the newest segment the most recent dict

we do that by grabbing the last dict and doing part_of_word?

we should rewrite the classes, segments should have letters in them

you could have more than one branch per start point (but that might make for redundant checking against the dict)

there is a problem happening with counting from zero when naming arrays, positions, and everything.
